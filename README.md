Please connect this app to your cytology lab to help diagnose breast cancer form your tissue sample. This app predicts using a machine learning model whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on the measurements it receives from your cytosis lab. You can also update the measurements by hand using the sliders in the sidebar.
